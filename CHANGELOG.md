# Changelog

These notes are written in plain English and focus on what changed for real use.

## 1.3.1
- JavaScript (.js) scripts are now supported alongside Lua scripts; UI renamed to "Scripts (Lua / JS)" everywhere.
- Script editor now includes a chip toggle to choose between `.lua` and `.js` file extensions when creating or editing scripts.
- Media title resolution improved: MPV's resolved title is preferred for non-direct-media URLs and when the current filename looks like a generic route (e.g., `/watch`, `/stream`).
- HTTP utility expanded with `shouldPreferResolvedMediaTitle()` and `hasDirectMediaExtension()`; junk-title detection now catches generic route names like "watch", "reels", "shorts".
