# Changelog

These notes are written in plain English and focus on what changed for real use.

## 1.5.0-preview.3 — Preview Release

### 🔊 Audio Blob Visualizer
- **OpenGL ES 3.0 blob visualizer** — when playing audio without cover art, a reactive 3D blob appears behind the player controls. The blob morphs, pulses, and shifts color based on audio energy with a bloom/glow post-process.
- **Touch rotation**: Drag the blob to rotate it in 3D.
- **Audio Preferences toggle**: New "Audio blob visualizer" switch in Settings > Audio to enable or disable it.

### 🎬 yt-dlp Changes
- **Audio quality preferences**: Independent bitrate caps for `Auto`, 64, 128, 192, and 256 kbps — composed with existing codec, resolution, FPS, HDR, and container selectors.
- **Serialized URL loading**: Initial and replacement URL loads now use one cancellable serialized job, preventing overlapping libmpv commands when links are pasted rapidly.
- **Graceful error recovery**: Recoverable URL load failures return to the player UI with an error message instead of escaping to the process-wide crash handler.

### 📻 Audio Browsing
- **MediaStore + filesystem discovery** for common audio formats, neutral media counts, audio MIME mapping, and Android 13 `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` permission handling.
- **Audio cards** show metadata titles, embedded cover artwork when available (via `audio-display=embedded-first`), and a music-note fallback icon.
- **Portrait-only playback** — audio files force sensor-portrait orientation and prevent the rotation action from switching back to landscape.
- **Sibling playlist includes audio** — when "Include audio" is on, the next/previous track list includes audio files from the same folder.

### 🌐 Network & External Playback
- **WebDAV PROPFIND fix**: Connection checks now use a depth-zero `PROPFIND` request instead of Sardine's `HEAD`-based `exists()` call, making it work with servers like FileBrowser Quantum that reject `HEAD` on DAV collections.
- **WebDAV trailing slash**: Collection URLs consistently keep a trailing slash during validation and browsing.
- **External-player discovery**: Added a MIME-only intent filter so external-player pickers can find mpvRx before attaching the final video or audio URI.

### 🌲 Tree View Navigation
- **Configurable path compression**: New `Off`, 1–5, and `Unlimited` choices for single-child folder flattening. Applied independently per navigation step, preserving predictable physical paths. Tree View refreshes instantly when the depth changes.

### 🎨 Icon Consistency
- Converted all three `painterResource(R.drawable.ic_material_symbols_check)` usages to `Icons.Default.Check` through the app's `AppIcon` / `Icon` system.
- `SectionHeader.leadingIcon` and `CompactExpressiveIconButton.imageVector` now accept `AppIcon` instead of raw `ImageVector`, keeping everything on the unified icon pipeline.

### 🔊 Audio Playback Runtime Fixes
- **`local_media_path` extra**: Internal launches now pass the resolved filesystem path alongside the content URI, giving mpv a reliable fallback when `content://` URIs fail.
- **Serialized load dispatcher**: Added a dedicated `Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)` dispatcher for media loading — prevents race conditions when queuing multiple load commands.
- **`vid=auto` before playback**: Non-M3U file loads explicitly reset the video track to auto before loading, avoiding "no video track" state from previous audio-only plays.
- **`audio-display=embedded-first`**: Enabled MPV's embedded cover art rendering for audio files.
- **Orientation on audio launch**: `setOrientation()` checks `isKnownAudioLaunch()` immediately, before the track-list event settles — fixes the black-screen + landscape glitch on audio start.

## 1.5.0-preview.2 — Preview Release

### 📦 MpvLib Update
- Updated mpv library and its dependencies

### ⚡ Performance & Startup
- **Faster video open**: Opening a video file now uses `Dispatchers.Default` for the `playFile()` call — keeps the UI thread free and the player starts faster
- **Leaner startup sync**: The MPV directory sync no longer blanket-copies `shaders/` and `fonts/` on every launch — only config files, scripts, and `script-opts/` are synced upfront. Shaders referenced in `mpv.conf` are pulled on demand via `syncReferencedShaders()`, and fonts are handled by the font manager. This cuts down startup time noticeably, especially for users with large shader packs
- **Removed Dynamic Speed Overlay**: The old `SpeedControlSlider` (a full-size overlay with a dot-track slider) and `CompactSpeedIndicator` are gone. Hold-speed is now shown as a simple, clean text pill (e.g. "2x"). The `showDynamicSpeedOverlay` preference has been removed too — no more toggles, no more clutter
- **Snap-to-preset hold speed**: The hold-speed gesture now snaps to fixed presets (0.5x → 1x → 1.5x → 2x → 2.5x → 3x → 3.5x → 4x) instead of a free-form slider. The settings slider also snaps to these values, so what you see is what you get
- **Hold speed range capped**: Boost speed is now capped at 0.5x–4x range (previously went up to 6x)

### 📱 Tablet Dual-Pane Layouts
- **Folder view dual pane**: On tablets (600dp+ smallest screen width), you can now see your folder list on the left and a video list on the right — tap a folder, see its contents immediately beside it. A new "Dual Pane View" toggle in Appearance Settings lets you turn this on/off
- **Settings dual pane**: The Settings screen also gets a two-panel layout on tablets — the section list stays on the left, and the selected settings page opens on the right. The currently active section is highlighted with a subtle background
- **Back navigation in dual pane**: Pressing back in dual-pane mode deselects the folder/settings page instead of closing the screen

### 🎥 Player & Subtitles
- **Invert swipe subtitle direction**: New "Invert swipe subtitles direction" setting in Gesture Preferences. When enabled, swiping left-to-right seeks backward and right-to-left seeks forward — useful if you prefer the mirrored behaviour
- **Screenshot overhaul**: Screenshot filename templates got a proper rework:
  - `%wH`, `%wM`, `%wS`, `%wT` now use the **video playback position** (not the wall clock time) — so screenshot filenames actually match the video timestamp
  - New template placeholders: `%F` (filename without extension), `%P` (position as `HH:MM:SS.mmm`), `%p` (position as `HH:MM:SS`)
  - `%f` now resolves from the actual filename first, falling back to media-title — more reliable naming
- **Korean Jamo subtitle fix**: Downloaded subtitles that use Korean Jamo (composite characters) now go through NFC Unicode normalization. No more broken/corrupted Korean glyphs in subtitles
- **Subtitle search keyboard fix**: Added `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` to PlayerActivity — the subtitle search dialog no longer gets hidden behind the on-screen keyboard
- **Subtitle persistence fix**: External subtitles and subtitle settings now survive across playback sessions more reliably. Added `addSubtitleSuspend()` (suspend version) for better coroutine handling during subtitle loading
- **Cache indicator fix**: The buffered range on the seekbar no longer double-counts the played portion — it now shows the correct remaining buffer ahead of the playhead
- **Color hex fix**: `toColorHexString()` now manually extracts ARGB components instead of using `Int.toHexString()` which produced wrong values for some colors

### 🛠️ Lua Script Improvements
- **Lua `require()` support**: Custom Lua scripts using `require()` can now find modules in `script-modules/` subdirectories. The app recursively syncs helper folders from `scripts/` to internal storage, so Lua's C-level `fopen()` can actually read them. Modules are also cleaned up when scripts are disabled in settings

### 🧹 Cleanup
- **Removed libpython binaries**: Deleted ~50 MB of unused `libpython_bin.so` files from all 4 architectures — they were never loaded by the app
- **Simplified MPV version display**: Removed the `cleanBundledMpvVersion()` hack in CrashActivity — MPV version now shows cleanly without needing string patching
- **Fonts folder no longer auto-set**: When changing the base storage root, the fonts folder preference is no longer blindly overwritten — it's only cleared if it was pointing at the old root. This prevents accidental font-folder resets

## 1.5.0-preview.1 — Preview Release

### 📦 MpvLib Update
- Updated mpv library and its dependencies 

### ⚡ Performance & Stability
- **Startup optimization**: Deferred cold-start DB initialization, grammar pre-load, and auto-update check to cut first-frame time significantly
- **Memory leak fixes**: Plugged 5 memory leaks across PlayerActivity (screen-state receiver), PlayerViewModel (LRU caches, temp subtitle cleanup), MediaPlaybackService (bitmap leak), MainActivity (unused scope), and NetworkLifecycleObserver (uncancelled coroutine)
- **UI smoothness**: Optimized seekbar spring animation, precomputed skip-segment colors, memoized immutable copies in PlayerControls, hoisted per-card preference collectors
- **Player crash fix**: Resolved a crash in PlayerActivity during stream initialization
- **Streaming optimizations**: Load network streams on `Dispatchers.IO` instead of Default to reduce CPU pool contention

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Dynamic Grids**: Added responsive grid layouts — auto-adjusts column count based on screen width across FileSystemBrowser, FolderList, VideoList, Playlist, and RecentlyPlayed screens
- **Centered controls**: Play/pause and navigation buttons now center in portrait mode
- **Haptic feedback**: Sort dialog sliders now provide haptic ticks on snap
- **Slider layout**: Column sliders placed side-by-side for better space usage
- **Theme refresh**: Boosted container saturation and surface tints across all themes (light/dark) for vivid, non-washed-out appearance
- **Subtitle sheet redesign**: Inline SeriesSelectionControls directly in the OnlineSubtitleSearchSheet search row
- **Compressor back-press fix**: Video compressor overlay now handles system back press correctly

### 🎥 Player & Streaming
- **HLS/DASH streaming fix**: Direct media URLs (.m3u8/.mpd/.mp4/.ts) now bypass yt-dlp and use mpv's native ffmpeg HLS demuxer — these streams previously failed in yt-dlp's generic extractor
- **yt-dlp audio selection**: New audio track selector in the yt-dlp panel; preferred languages sanitization for better auto-selection
- **Collapsible advanced settings**: YtdlpSettingsScreen now organizes advanced options under collapsible sections
- **Console option**: Added Console toggle in MoreSheet stats rows — opens the mpv debug console via script-message
- **Subtitle hitbox fixes**: Dynamic hitbox detection for multi-line wrapped text; fixed hitbox under zoom/pan; lowered minimum subtitle scale limit
- **Subtitle loading fix**: Fixed subtitle loading and player overlay issues with IntentSubtitleLoadPolicy and M3uPlaybackPolicy
- **Negative brightness**: Added negative brightness range support in vertical sliders
- **Streaming overlays**: Fixed streaming playback overlays and thumbnail rendering

### 🔍 Anime Skip Provider
- New **Anime Skip** provider (api.anime-skip.com GraphQL) for intro/ending detection — searches via MAL ID, pairs consecutive timestamps
- Removed dead db.videasy.net TMDB mirror (providers now skip IMDB resolution without it)
- Cleaned up WyzieSearchRepository: removed fallback mirror logic and dead VideasyTmdbTrendingResponse

### 📁 Media Search Engine
- **New MediaSearchEngine**: Dedicated search engine for searching files/folders with optimized indexing
- **FolderListScreen integration**: Search across folders and videos using the new engine with VideoFolder references
- **Multiple refactors**: Cleaned up search logic, improved readability, and added Kotlin smart-casting clarifications

## 1.3.9

> # 🚀 **CURL IS NOW SUPPORTED!** 
> ### ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL** — This is brand new and may or may not work properly on your device. ⚠️
> Lua and JavaScript scripts can now make HTTP requests through the new native libcurl bridge via JNI.
> Use it, break it, and report issues so we can make it stable!, see `MPVRX_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.d` for tutorial on how to use in Lua and JS.
>
> **What this means:** You can now write scripts that fetch data from the internet — APIs, subtitles, metadata, you name it — all through libcurl compiled directly into the app.

- AI support has been updated. Gemini is removed and OpenCode Zen AI is now available for AI rename, subtitle formatting, and subtitle translation.
- AI model lists now come from the provider APIs instead of a saved model list in the app. OpenRouter also marks free models using the pricing data returned by OpenRouter itself.
- Background playback is fixed so repeat keeps working after using the headphone button, and returning to the player no longer restarts the current stream from the beginning.
- Subtitle search has been updated for the latest Wyzie source changes.
- Added Hybrid Skip Markers. The player can now check IntroDB, TIDB, and AniSkip together and use whichever result is found first.
- Anime4K settings are now easier to use with a collapsible section in Decoder Preferences and also Added Optimization by Sunny Vishnu .
- Added a setting to show or hide Media Info from Android's share/open-with screen.
- Added documentation for custom Lua/JS player commands in `MPVRX_CUSTOM_COMMANDS.md`.

## 1.3.8

- **Integrated yt-dlp by [**SunnyVishnu3**](https://github.com/SunnyVishnu3)** — Added full yt-dlp integration for video watching audio/video from YouTube and other supported sites directly within the app (_Dont expect from me to add Download Functionality_). **Note: You need to download yt-dlp first (Settings > Advanced > yt-dlp Manager) before playing YouTube links — don't be clueless.**
- Fixed Issue of USer defined Colors Filters were not getting Saved and not getting applied through Mpv conf by [**SunnyVishnu3**](https://github.com/SunnyVishnu3)
- Fixed Gemini AI Error Generating / Translating Subs.
- Fixed Crashing issue of MpvRx , in a nutshell Ambient mode and Custom lua were not initialized in Sync causing to crash player sometimes
- That's all for Today Adiosss!!

## 1.3.7

- **Updated Wyzie subtitle API integration** — Synced with latest Wyzie API changes: added `ai` field for AI-translated subtitle detection, updated provider sources list (removed `subdl`, `podnapisi`, `ajatttools`; added `tvsubtitles`), and fixed TMDB endpoints to include API key authentication.
- **Material 3 Expressive Design** — Complete visual overhaul using Material 3 Expressive design system for a more modern, fluid, and engaging experience
- **Smoother Animations** — Replaced rigid linear transitions with spring-based physics animations throughout the app (navigation, controls, browser, dialogs)
- Added Voltage Battery Temperature And improved the style of Page 6 
- Added Optimized Ambient Mode with Eco Battery Saver Mode who want to take feel of Ambient without much Battery Impact
- Removed Dead Code and also Optimized some File Handling / Ui Rendering Operations
- **Settings export now stores app version**  exported XML files include the app version, so import dialogs show the correct version instead of "unknown".
- **HEVC 10bit thumbnails**  added a software-decoder fallback using Android's MediaCodec API. When the system can't decode a video frame (e.g. HEVC 10bit on devices without hardware support), the app now tries Google's software decoder before giving up. This means more thumbnails will show up on devices with limited codec support ( To be tested Propelry on unsupported device).
- **Fixed app icon on Android 16**  changed the adaptive icon background from transparent to opaque black so the icon doesn't disappear on launchers that don't handle transparency well.
- **User mpv.conf now has highest priority**  during player startup, your mpv.conf settings are re-applied after all app defaults so they always take precedence. but some of the Hardcoded things doesnt change like for example `sid, aid`.
- 

## 1.3.6

- **Six AI providers, one gorgeous settings page**  OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Together joined Groq and Gemini in a completely redesigned UI. Every provider gets its own API key, every single model is visible (free ones get a bold green badge), and the new searchable model picker sorts free models to the top. The offline model experience got a premium card-based overhaul too  tiers, speed/translation badges, device recommendations, DeepSeek-R1 support, reasoning toggles, and a benchmark button for downloaded models. One-tap download, delete, and switch between models without ever leaving the screen.

- **Subtitle translation**  SUPPORTS ASS Subs Translation tooooooooo..... , you can now configure your target languages once in settings. One language means one tap to translate. Two or more means a clean picker showing only the languages you chose. Translation progress appears right on the video screen (even with the sheet closed), partially translated subs survive restarts, and a red X lets you cancel mid-translation instantly. When using local models, the system automatically picks the best downloaded model for each language, keeps it warm between chunks, and never runs two local AI jobs at once.

- **Generate subtitles from video audio**  **_(EXPERIMENTAL)_** This is work in progress might not work Don't baby Cry that this shit aint working ,i ain't getting paid enough to implement this whole heartedly , so what it does is -> one tap generates subtitles using the audio you're already playing. Media3 extraction feeds Groq, Gemini, or offline Whisper, and the resulting SRT/VTT saves automatically.

- **Smarter AI across the board**  reasoning tags are automatically stripped from final results, token limits prevent stalls in heavy tasks, and every AI feature (rename, formatting, translation) comes with customizable prompts that fall back gracefully to built-in instructions.

- **Real-time subtitle toggle**  new on/off switch in AI settings to control real-time subtitle generation from audio. When off, the indicator and generate button are hidden from the player.

- **AI features respect the master switch**  turning off AI Integration now hides all AI indicators (translation, real-time subs) and buttons (generate, translate, format) from the player view. Renamed "AI Subtitle Search Formatting" to "AI Search" for clarity.


## 1.3.5

- **Removed Play Store and F-Droid build variants**  streamlined to a single `standard` flavor with full update support and all features enabled.
- **Revamped README**  comprehensive feature documentation organized by category, UPI QR code and Buy Me a Coffee links in the Support section.
- **SMB Network Thumbnail Generation**  fixed thumbnail generation for SMB shares through Codex AI (Beta).
- **Bulk AI Rename**  rename multiple files at once using Gemini or Groq with concurrency limiting and edge case handling.
- **AI Subtitle Translation**  translate subtitles using AI providers with custom prompts, progress indication, and user preference management.
- **AI Subtitle Translation Enhancements**  in-house developed translation pipeline with fully customizable prompts and per-user preference overrides.

## 1.3.4

- Capped generated thumbnails to safer preview sizes so large videos do not waste memory while browsing.
- Improved MKV/WebM thumbnail handling, including embedded artwork and smarter fallback frames.
- Cleaned old thumbnail cache paths when clearing thumbnail cache.
- Fixed the About and crash info screen showing `UNKNOWN` in the bundled mpv version.

- Cleaned up codebase and Improved Playback bottlenecks
- Added Window Offset to prevent Camera notch overlap issues


## 1.3.3

- Fixed Background Playback and Pip issues 
- Anime4K should feel much smoother now. The player now uses the clean six-preset Anime4K flow from the reference app and avoids piling old shader work on top of the new preset when you switch modes.
- Anime4K is still off by default, but when you turn it on the picker is simpler: Off, A, B, C, A+, B+, and C+.
- Moved the Fast / Balanced / High Anime4K choice into Decoder settings, with Balanced as the default.
- Removed frame interpolation because it added a lot of GPU load and did not add enough real value.
- Removed the old OneThird and Halfway thumbnail choices.
- Removed the unused old player screen path.
- Cleaned up the track sheets so audio, subtitle, chapter, decoder, and online subtitle lists no longer depend on the old generic sheet.
- Removed SubDL from subtitle search sources.
- Network streaming is now opt-in instead of being enabled on a fresh install.
- HDR and Ambient controls are no longer placed on the default player buttons, so heavy visual extras stay out of the way unless you add them yourself.
- Turning HDR on now starts with Linear HDR by default.
- The app now does less background media scanning and cache cleanup on startup, which should help large libraries open with less churn.
- Added new MpvLib File with Some Optimization and Removing Deprecated Andorid Versions
- Thumbnails are now Loaded Faster and more Precisly

## 1.3.2

### HDR hdr-toys Pipeline

- Replaced the old 3-mode HDR system (Off / SDR with HDR / Normal HDR) with a proper shader-based pipeline powered by [hdr-toys](https://github.com/natural-harmonia-gropius/hdr-toys).
- Four HDR modes are now available: **BT.2100 PQ** (HDR10), **BT.2100 HLG**, **BT.2020**, and **Linear HDR** (mpv-native, no shaders).
- 77 GLSL shaders are bundled in the app and copied to the mpv config directory on first use  no manual setup required.
- The HDR panel no longer shows an "Off" option. Off is the default and is toggled by the HDR button; the panel only presents the four active modes.
- Selecting a mode while GPU Next + Vulkan is unavailable shows a clear error pill and falls back to Off safely.
- Added `boostSdrToHdr` preference (used by the Linear HDR path).
- `HdrToysManager` cleanly removes all hdr-toys shaders when switching to Off or when the pipeline is not ready, so no stale shaders leak between sessions.

### Thermal & Battery Improvements

- Added `ThermalMonitor`  samples `PowerManager.getThermalHeadroom()` (Android 11+) every 10 seconds during playback.
- Ambient shader sample budget is automatically capped based on thermal headroom: 8 samples (severe), 12 (moderate), 18 (mild), uncapped (cool).
- Anime4K is proactively downgraded to C/Fast when thermal headroom drops below 40%, before frame drops even start.
- Ambient shader recompilation is now skipped when all parameters are identical to the last compiled version  reduces unnecessary GPU stutter on orientation changes and no-op callbacks.
- Removed redundant dual position polling: the event-driven `time-pos` observer and the polling loop were both updating the same StateFlow, causing double seek-bar recompositions on every MPV event.
- Background playback position poll interval halved from 250 ms to 500 ms when controls are not visible, cutting idle JNI wake-ups by 50%.

### Stats Page 6  Fixes

- **GPU estimate bar fixed**: was using cumulative drop + delay totals that drifted to 100% after long sessions and added a fixed FPS-proportional baseline (120fps with zero drops showed 70% GPU load). Now uses per-second delta counts relative to the current frame rate  0 drops = 0%, all frames dropped = 100%.
- **CPU label corrected**: relabelled from "CPU Usage" to "App CPU (this process)" to accurately reflect that `getElapsedCpuTime()` measures only MpvRx's own process, not the whole device.
- **Frame drop text now shows per-second deltas** alongside the all-time totals, so you can tell current rendering pressure at a glance.
- **Pause-aware poll backoff**: the stats loop backs off from 1 s to 2 s intervals when playback is paused, cutting pointless JNI calls when metrics are static.

### Gesture & Action Overlay Toggles

- Added a new **"Gesture & Action Overlays"** section in Player Settings with seven independent on/off switches:
  - **Volume slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during volume swipe
  - **Brightness slider overlay**  vertical pill shown during brightness swipe
  - **Hold speed overlay**  speed badge and slider shown during long-press speed boost
  - **Aspect ratio feedback**  pill shown when cycling aspect ratio
  - **Zoom level feedback**  pill shown when pinching to zoom
  - **Repeat & shuffle feedback**  pill shown when toggling repeat or shuffle
  - **Action feedback pills**  brief text pills from custom buttons, ambient toggle, subtitle drag, and Lua/JS scripts
- All overlays default to **on**, so existing behaviour is unchanged until the user opts out.
- Disabling an overlay suppresses only the visual pill  the underlying gesture action (volume change, speed change, etc.) still happens normally.

## 1.3.1

- Updated mpv library dependency from `mpv-android-lib-v0.0.1.aar` to `mpvlib.aar` and removed the old AAR.
- Added Multiple new provider to Wyzie subtitle sources.
- PiP and background playback now save the latest watched position instead of returning to the timestamp from before PiP started.
